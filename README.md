As is known, XML is used for storing data in markup form, to seperate data from presentation. In this repository XML is converted into
a document object by using XSLT. With XSLT an XML document can be transformed to HTML. 

# Elements
Several XSLT elements are used to obtain information from our XML. This information is then built into
an HTML file which is displayed on the web page.
